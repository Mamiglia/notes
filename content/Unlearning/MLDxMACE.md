Apply MACE to pose forecasting, and MLD in particular. We can try to:
1. Forget specific motion types, e.g. rolling, jumping etc...
2. "Forget" incoherent motions, e.g. floating foot, waving 

## Issues
- Mask: MACE uses a Mask obtained form Grounded-SAM, then penalizes the cross-attention map between the input text and the pixels in that mask. We argue that since there's no background or unimportant joints in motion that mask is not needed at all.
- MACE finetunes only cross-attention and embedding layers, so those parts of the network that are conditioned by external prompts. In the *incoherent motions* setting the problem is that these are not generated by a specific prompt, but rather by the inability of the model of producing coherent movements. I would argue that we don't need the model to forget something, rather to learn coherence.
